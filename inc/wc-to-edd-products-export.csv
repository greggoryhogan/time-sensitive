Some of these topics are not discussed in church -- but should be! This 5-week series goes into five major issues that can affect any believer, and what Scripture has to say about them.

5 Weeks:
Week 1: Doubt
Doubt is normal. Share your doubt with people you trust and it will only be temporary.

Scripture: Galatians 6; John 20; Hebrews 11; Genesis 16

Week 2: Sexuality
We cannot treat someone badly just because their sin looks different than our own.

Scripture: 1 John 3; Matthew 5; John 13; Ephesians 4

Week 3: Addiction
You have something that no drug could ever duplicate and no habit could ever replace -- the knowledge that the creator of the universe and everything in it is sitting next to you personally while you go through your painful season, weeping with you and comforting you in the way that only he can.

Scripture: Psalm 24; Psalm 147; 2 Corinthians 12; Isaiah 53

Week 4: Depression and Self Image
If God himself -- the creator of the universe and everything in it -- believes that we are acceptable, capable, valuable, will never leave us alone, and will always forgive us; why should we believe any different?

Scripture: Jonah 4; 1 Peter 2

Week 5: Hell
This special discussion-based message is designed to open a dialog between you and your students on the reality and aspect of Hell.

Scripture: Revelation 14; Jeremiah 7

Alone, scared, guilt ridden, stuck. Scrolling through my Facebook feed, I saw the Lifehouse skit video shared by someone, and it wrecked me.

In that moment, the plans I had laid out for myself and the plans God had for me crashed into one another, and the aftermath left me picking up the pieces and rebuilding a far great life than I could have ever imagined.

Life is full of these types of moments, where we are wrecked. Sometimes it's in a way that humbles us, like my moment above. Other times, God leaves us in such Awe of Him, we leave the moment wrecked. This series spends 4 weeks looking at four different types of moments where God wrecks us, and how to deal with the aftermath. The end goal of each session is that we shouldn't fear these moments, because they lead to greater growth, deeper walks, new purposes in our lives.

It was written with Andy Stanley's 'ME, WE, GOD, YOU, WE' format, it was written to first build tension and show how everyone is effected by this one thing and then resolve the tension with what God says on the matter. It has two YouTube videos to be shown, which play really well into the message and all of the teens loved them.

Students will be comfortable answering their peers' questions of faith after this series!
&lt;h4&gt;3 Week Series&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Week 1 Did God really create everything?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;Did God really create everything? Did He? You might be skeptical about that question. In case you didn&rsquo;t know, we&rsquo;re talking about how we can trust that the creation story is true. But, when you really think about, did God create the Heavens and the Earth, the galaxies, and everything in between?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 1&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Week 2-Did Jesus really exist?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;Did Jesus really exist? Apart from the Bible stories we hear, do you really believe that Jesus existed 2,000 years ago in the flesh? This is a topic we all need to explore.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 15:13-19&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Week 3-Is there really an afterlife?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;So, when we die, what happens? Do we actually have life after we die? Do we go to Heaven? What exactly happens? Let&rsquo;s explore what Solomon had to say about this topic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Week 1:&nbsp;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;Don't give up on God because of pain caused by others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;Jesus still loves you and them when they hurt you.&nbsp;We need to forgive the person who caused the pain in our life.&nbsp;Jesus gives us the strength to live through the pain others cause.&lt;/span&gt;

He uses the language 'when' instead of the language 'if.' It was not a hope, but an assumption that believers would pray. This 3-part series will cover first the necessity of prayer, then will look at the ACTS method of prayer, and will finish off looking at how we can pray with effectiveness. This journey is certain to transform your understanding of prayer, especially week three, as we look at how our actions can determine the effectiveness of our prayer.

Solomon spent the entire book of Ecclesiastes talking about this very subject, which is very applicable to students today. This one-off sermon will help your students see that there is more to life than the here and now, and give them six practical steps to begin living out a fulfilling life found only in God.

They compete for deep seated longing in the desires of people, and they make grand promises of fulfillment from new products and gadgets. They are smart. They know each person is created with deep desires springing from our basic needs for freedom, connection, accomplishment and significance. But they miss, year after year. Those &ldquo;got to have&rdquo; products don&rsquo;t fulfill the way they promise. They fade over time and become novelties.

This VIVA! series focuses on humanity&rsquo;s search for fulfillment. Every teenager has their wish list: Beats headphones, selfie sticks, Instax cameras, iPhone S&rsquo;s, infinity scarves. They top the list of this year&rsquo;s wishing season. Behind these wish-lists are the deeper desires of their lives. These lessons dig deeper into those hoped for gifts to find the lives God created teenagers for. They reveal the basic needs we all struggle to find through things and how they can only be found in Christ.

Jesus speaks to the hopes and joys people had been waiting for, and opens up the transformative work of it all to those who believe, then and now.

This VIVA! Series will guide your group through Jesus&rsquo;s sermon and, from later in his life, his mind-blowing promise that those who believe in him will do even greater things&mdash;and that we have everything we need to be a part of it all, right now, today.

Week 1: What does it mean to know the poor well enough to be able to truly bring good news, today?

Week 2: Is there anything more intimidating that being asked to free prisoners and restore sight to those who are blind? Well, Jesus asks it of us, and we&rsquo;ll discuss how that can look, today.

Week 3: Today, we can be a part of setting the oppressed free and proclaiming the year of the Lord&rsquo;s favor. But first we should take a look at what that actually means and why it&rsquo;s worth fighting for.

Week 4: Phew, we finally worked our way through the high-bar topics from within Jesus&rsquo;s first sermon and can move on to some nice words he shared near the end of his life, right? Like when he said &ldquo;Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these&hellip;&rdquo; Uh, what? Greater things than Jesus? What do we do with that??

Titus","2019-01-11 02:33:54",1,"Growing in our relationship with Christ isn&rsquo;t just for people who attend services or youth group, but it&rsquo;s also for those who are leading the church. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how long someone has been a Christ follower or what title they may hold in leadership; there are always ways that we can grow more in the likeness of Jesus. The letter written by Paul to Titus helps remind us of this lesson.

During one of his missionary journeys, Paul left Titus on the island of Crete to lead the church community there. He then writes to encourage Titus in his own faith, give him guidance on organizing the church, who to appoint as leaders, and advise him on the things he should be teaching to the community. Most of all, he reminds Titus repeatedly in the letter what the whole point of his work really is.

Viva! Titus will explore this letter from Paul and discuss how the lessons written for Titus and the Cretans back in the first century translate to our lives today. Here is what we&rsquo;ll be discussing:

Week 1: The Plan (Titus 1:1-4)

Week 2: Leading Well (Titus 1:5-16)

Week 3: Living Well (Titus 2:1-3:2)

When it was first starting after Christ ascended to heaven, his first followers didn&rsquo;t have church growth books to build from. Regardless, these followers of The Way, charged ahead with a passion to share the story about Jesus and build a community centered around his resurrection.

The book of Acts tells the story about how these early Christians were coming together, what they cared most about and how they were living out their faith in Jesus. This series of Viva! will explore four important stories from the life of the early church and ask how we can apply them to our lives today.

159446,viva-the-christmas-story,"Viva! The Christmas Story","2019-01-11 02:32:52",1,"Thanks to nativity scenes and Christmas pageants, most people are familiar with the story of Jesus&rsquo; birth&hellip;but maybe we&rsquo;re too familiar? The fact is, nativity scenes and your typical Christmas pageants that chronologically tell the Christmas story aren&rsquo;t the full story. When you read the Gospel accounts of the birth of Christ, you have two different stories (Matthew and Luke) that don&rsquo;t line up easily. Additionally, John offers a metaphorical account while Mark, the first gospel written, apparently didn&rsquo;t feel that the virgin birth story was worth mentioning.

Rather than just taking the Gospel records and combining them to fit a historical timeline, it&rsquo;s important to take the time to understand what each God-inspired author is trying to communicate with the way they tell the story. Each writer is purposeful about what they include and why. In this VIVA! Series we will invite your group into exploring these elements as you explore the Christmas stories of the Bible. Here is what we&rsquo;ll be discussing:

159423,viva-stewardship,"Viva! Stewardship","2019-01-11 02:32:42",1,"Stewardship. One of the most church-y words of them all that calls to mind sermons on money, remembering to tithe our money, and passing around collection plates for&hellip; money.

But what if the word was able to mean more to us, and especially our youth, than just money? What if the word stewardship drew up feelings of inspiration, blessing, and possibility?

This VIVA! series will help you and your students reclaim the word stewardship from simply meaning to tithe, and allow it to drive their thinking in terms of blessing, possibility, creation care, time, and yes, money.

Week 1: To Bless Others
To be a steward is to be someone who looks after, or takes care of, what has been entrusted to you. One of the most important things we as followers of Jesus have been called to do is care for each other. This week&rsquo;s lesson will help us to see our participation in stewardship as a direct call from God to take the resources available in His kingdom and use them to bless others.

Week 2: Time
365 days in a year. 24 hours in a day. 60 minutes in an hour. 60 seconds in a minute.

We have zero control over time. There is nothing we can do to slow it down, speed it up, or hit pause like Zack Morris. Some people fill their days with near-constant activities and expectations while others sit around waiting for something to do that feels worth getting off the couch for. In this lesson your group will get a chance to take a look at themselves as stewards of time, discussing what it could look like to manage their time in a way that honors themselves, those around them, and God.

Week 3: Creation
At times it is necessary to take a step back and appreciate just how big God is. In the entirety of the known and unknown universe there is but one earth: one place where life of all kinds exists and thrives as part of God&rsquo;s good plan. Scripture makes it clear that one of the greatest gifts we have been given is the earth and all that&rsquo;s within it. As humans, we were given that gift along with the great responsibility of being its stewards. This lesson will help your group wrestle with the ways we have, and haven&rsquo;t, been good stewards of the earth God created.

Week 4: Money
For better or worse, money makes the world go &lsquo;round. This week&rsquo;s lesson will create opportunities for reflection and discussion to help your group be stewards of their money in such a way that our world may go &lsquo;round, a little more often, for the better.

They&rsquo;ll take a look at where their money comes from, how it gets spent, how it can be used to bless or curse, and, yes, how it can be given to support the work of the church.

Passion","2019-01-11 02:27:20",1,"The Entry &ndash; Jesus begins his final week of life by riding into Jerusalem during Passover and announcing his reign as King&hellip; on a donkey. How did Jesus&rsquo; entrance into Jerusalem show him to be far more than just a humble man willing to ride on a donkey, but as a King who was subverting the expectations of the powerful and peasant alike?

The Temple &ndash; This lesson will explore the temple culture, Jesus&rsquo;s reaction to it and how we can allow him to &ldquo;turn things over&rdquo; in our lives.

The Curtain &ndash; This lesson will continue our look at the last week of Christ&rsquo;s life and specifically key in on the tearing of the temple curtain after his death. The temple, and more specifically the Holy of Holies, was where God dwelled, where heaven met earth. The curtain separating us from God came down so we all can experience and participate in heaven meeting earth without barrier.

The Mission &ndash; Betrayal, violence, death and disappointment. What a way for the last week of Jesus&rsquo;s life to wrap up. But then Jesus comes back- with more power and authority than ever. This lesson will look at how the resurrected Jesus chose not to confront his enemies, but to spend the time to find his followers, put his arm around them and bring them back into his mission. The same mission we get to participate in today.

All groups benefit from preparation. So take some time, if you have it, to read through the lesson before you meet.

Each of these lessons can be led in different ways. Please be sensitive to your group. You might have a group that really wants to dig into an idea, or you might have a group that just needs to hear the basic truth. You get to decide that as you meet.

Finally, please feel free to discard any of this content to stay in your group&rsquo;s context. The best curriculum for your group is you, caring for them as they get to know God.

Viva is Alive includes PDF files for your lessons.

87046,viva-one-offs,"Viva! One-Offs","2019-01-11 02:27:25",1,"We&rsquo;re trying something a little different with this round of VIVA! We know there are times when what you need is not a four week series, but a one-off lesson to fill the gaps. We know the reality of a Saturday night &ldquo;Oh no, we don&rsquo;t have a lesson for tomorrow morning!&rdquo; moment, and we are here to help. VIVA! One-Offs are full lessons that can stand on their own. An hour&rsquo;s worth of activities, content and discussion that doesn&rsquo;t need to be part of a series, but can still help your group take a look at scripture and a topic that matters in their world.

Week 1: Music &amp;amp; Worship

Music is constantly around us. It&rsquo;s playing overhead at the coffee shop, it&rsquo;s in the soundtrack of our favorite TV shows or movies, and it&rsquo;s in the songs constantly flowing out of small white earbuds into our ears and our brains. As a species, we love music. Using discussion, scripture, and the lyrics of your group&rsquo;s favorite worship songs, we&rsquo;ll spend this lesson looking at worship and music and why they work so effectively to connect us to God.

Week 2: Education

School is hard. Understanding calculus and Chaucer is tough enough. But that&rsquo;s not nearly as hard to deal with as the pressure to live up to the expectations of parents, friends, ourselves-and to achieve the American Dream. We need to get the grades to get into the school to get the job to get the money to get the secure future. But does this view of education make sense in God&rsquo;s Kingdom, or has there been a disconnect somewhere along the way?

Week 3: Worthy

We all have labels we wear. Some we give to ourselves and some are given to us by those in our life. Our labels too often make us feel like we aren&rsquo;t good enough or worth enough when Jesus is wanting to give us different, truer labels that mark us as worthy. This week&rsquo;s lesson will use a simple self-portrait, the story of Jesus&rsquo;s interaction with the woman at the well, and a lot of discussion to show each of us that not only do we have worth, but we are worthy.

Week 4: Fear

There are plenty of things in life to be afraid of: spiders and snakes, falling off a cliff while hiking, giving a presentation in school and forgetting each and every word of it. A lot of us also have fear and anxiety about less tangible things, such as losing a friendship, disappointing our parents, or the future. We all probably know, on some level, that the Bible is full of verses that tell us not to fear or be afraid, but not many of us take the time to put that wisdom into practice in our lives. This lesson will help your group take a look at their fears (both obvious and less tangible) and see how those feelings can interact with scripture&rsquo;s assurance of comfort.

87028,viva-one-another,"Viva! One Another","2019-01-11 02:27:18",1,"At any given point throughout the day we are surrounded by other people. At home, at school, at the gym, at work, at restaurants, etc. And at each of those points, we choose how we will interact with one another. Will we ignore? Love? Mock? Accept?

As followers of Jesus we have some pretty clear directions as to how we should interact with one another-whether those closest to us or those we seemingly would have no cause to speak to. This four week set of VIVA contains games, videos, scripture exploration, discussion questions and more that will help us to see just how we are called to one another.

Week 1: Love One Another (John 13:33-35)

Ahhh yes, love. A word that can feel cliche in the Christian faith-but there&rsquo;s no escaping just how foundational love is when living in the way of Jesus. In this week&rsquo;s lesson your group will have the chance to look at the task Jesus gives his disciples to carry out once he is gone: to love one another. Loving one another, Jesus says, is actually the most effective way to help the world recognize who God is.

Week 2: Honor One Another (Romans 12:9-13)

When we think of giving someone an honor, those thoughts usually include things like ceremonies, medals, and plaques. But what does it mean to truly honor one another in the way scripture speaks of? This lesson will help your group explore Romans 12 and see whether Paul meant for us to frequently hold ceremonies of honor for one another or if it was something much simpler, but just as meaningful, that he had in mind.

Week 3: Carry One Another&rsquo;s Burdens (Galatians 6:2-3)

In Galatians, Paul lets the reader know that one of the most important ways we can be in true community is to carry one another&rsquo;s burdens. But, as Paul writes, in order to do so we have to know one another, and know what other people are going through. Our sin, our mess, our hardships. This week&rsquo;s lesson is another look at a two-way street where the followers of Jesus are not only asked to carry the burdens of their community, but to allow their community to know and carry their own burdens.

Week 4: Encourage One Another (1 Thessalonians 5:9-11)

As your group wraps up this series on One Another, you&rsquo;ll get an opportunity to look at what Paul meant when he said we must encourage one another. How can encouragement look like something more in our lives than having a personal cheerleader follow us around with pompoms while we do chores or take tests? How can encouragement not simply be something that&rsquo;s done in recognition of our accomplishments, but something that moves us toward Jesus?

This lesson will use skits, video, and more to create dialogue and movement as your group explores what Paul meant when he said, &ldquo;Therefore encourage one another.&rdquo;

159440,viva-new-eyes,"Viva! New Eyes","2019-01-11 02:32:50",1,"For teens who have grown up around church, there are those Bible passages that they&rsquo;ve heard a hundred times. They heard them as kids, they heard them in youth group and they heard them in sermons. It&rsquo;s become so tempting for them to just skip over them because they &ldquo;know&rdquo; what they say.

But here&rsquo;s the thing: what if we don&rsquo;t? The challenge that the Bible brings is that the most recent letters were written down almost 2,000 years ago and the Bible that you hold has been translated a few times over. Reading the Bible isn&rsquo;t so simple because just taking the English words at face value may miss things going on in the original language or context. The fact is, there are some amazing and insightful things going on in the text if we just learn to dig a little and see things with new eyes.

This is what this Viva! is all about. We&rsquo;ll explore four passages where you may be tempted to say, &ldquo;Been there, done that,&rdquo; and we&rsquo;ll ask some questions and dig a little to see if there are some things we may have missed beneath the surface.

Here is what we&rsquo;ll be discussing in Viva! New Eyes:

Week 1: The Lost Son (Luke 15:11-32)

Week 2: The Great Commission (Matthew 28:16-20)

Week 3: Spiritual Gifts (1 Corinthians 12:1-11)

Week 4: Creation (Genesis 1:1-2:3)

Following Jesus means that we are actively working to bring about heaven on earth in the here and now. That is the mission of the Church and everyone is invited to participate.

In the book of Acts, Jesus told his first followers that they would be his &ldquo;witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&rdquo; This series of Viva! will explore four stories from the life of the early church about how serving that mission started to take shape and what we can learn about continuing to live it out.

Here is what we&rsquo;ll be discussing in Viva! Missions

Week 1: Seven Are Chosen (Acts 6:1-15)

Week 2: Simon the Sorcerer (Acts 8:9-25)

What matters about Jonah is that it&rsquo;s the clever story of a somewhat burned out prophet who has lost his motivation to follow God&rsquo;s leading along with his desire to see anyone actually respond to God&rsquo;s message!

This VIVA! Series will have your youth unpacking Jonah&rsquo;s attitudes and motivation for reflection on their own opportunities to participate in kingdom work as they follow him through:

Week 1: Trouble! Jonah hears from God and makes a town line dash, only to endanger a boatload of innocent sailors.
Week 2: Time Out: Jonah finds himself in the penalty box with plenty of time to think.
Week 3: Trabajo (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;work&rdquo; in Spanish): Jonah finally gets down to business. Sort of.
Week 4: Temper Tantrum: Jonah&rsquo;s true self emerges, revealing the reality of his attitude toward honoring God with his life.",,draft,Uncategorized,,6.00,https://s3.amazonaws.com/adammclane/viva23.zip,-1,,,,0,0

In our current culture, we&rsquo;re relatively removed from the older concepts of inheritance and birthright that dictate the movement of power and occasional wealth in scripture. Also common in the culture of our scripture is the tendency toward exclusion of women, a trend that still has hurdles to overcome today.

In this Viva! Series, your youth will have an opportunity to unpack some of the challenges to inheritance that women in our scripture faced, through the eyes of four lesser-explored female characters.

This VIVA! Series will walk down that road a little as it unpacks one of the most familiar verses from the minor prophets of scripture, Micah 6:8:

Week 1: Act Justly&mdash;what&rsquo;s the least the rest of the world should be able to count on from Christians?

Week 2: Love Mercy&mdash;what does it look like for us to step across the line of &ldquo;least required&rdquo;?

Week 3: Walk Humbly&mdash;how can we reshape the way we participate in public conversation, especially when we disagree?

Week 4: With God&mdash;what&rsquo;s the point in doing all of this, anyway?

From there we look at the introduction of man into the world. Next, we take a look at the story of Noah. Finally, we take a look at the life of Abraham as God moves His creation from the fall of man to the restoration that&rsquo;ll ultimately be found in Jesus.

159442,viva-doubt,"Viva! Doubt","2019-01-11 02:32:50",1,"What is the role of doubt within our faith? There are some Christians who treat doubt like it&rsquo;s a bad thing, but the truth is that doubt is totally normal for all of us, no matter the depth of our faith. More so, without doubt we wouldn&rsquo;t need to have faith because we would be certain of everything we believe.

The fact is, the very thing that helps our faith grow and mature is doubt. Doubts are what lead to questions, which leads to digging deeper and exploring at greater depths, which then can lead to new truths and better understandings. In contrast, when we ignore our doubts, it damages and cheapens our faith because we cannot fully commitment to something we have not adequately explored.

This is what this Viva! will explore. We&rsquo;ll look at four stories in the Bible that raise a lot of questions and doubts. We&rsquo;ll lean in to some of the challenges these passages present and see if there are other ways to understand the accounts. Here is what we&rsquo;ll be discussing:

Week 1: Noah and the Flood

Week 2: Exodus and the Ten Plagues

Week 3: Jonah and the Fish

Week 4: Ananias and Sapphira Drop Dead

159432,viva-death-resurrection,"Viva! Death &amp; Resurrection","2019-01-11 02:32:45",1,"Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection are the most important factors when it comes to following Jesus. The Apostle Paul bluntly wrote in 1 Corinthians 15:14 that if it weren&rsquo;t for the resurrection, which obviously required Christ to die first, our faith would be totally pointless. As important and familiar as the story is to many, what often gets overlooked is the way the four accounts that we have at times differ from one another. Some include content that the others don&rsquo;t. Why? Some of the authors contradict the others in some of the details. Why?

For some, these differences have led them to discredit the entire event of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. However, if we take the time to understand what the God-inspired authors are trying to communicate with the way they tell the story, it can lead to greater depth. This VIVA! Series will invite your group into these differences as you explore the most important story in the Bible. Here is what we&rsquo;ll be discussing:

Week 1: Mark&rsquo;s Account

Week 2: Matthew&rsquo;s Account

Week 3: Luke&rsquo;s Account

Week 4: John&rsquo;s Account

Even though being in community means a group of people coming together, healthy community starts with us as individuals. The way we approach a group and the attitudes that we embrace are what will drive whether or not the communities we find ourselves in are healthy or not. In Viva!

159428,viva-colossians,"Viva! Colossians","2019-01-11 02:32:43",1,"Many teenagers (as well as adults!) question Christianity today. They look at it as just one of many ways that we can connect with God and they ask if absolute truth even exists. If we&rsquo;re honest, many even see Jesus, and more so the Bible, as outdated and irrelevant, and they set out to forge their own way to God. Interestingly the questions that get asked today about religion and the way to God are not the first time they are being asked. In fact, they&rsquo;ve been asked since the beginning of humanity and are the exact questions that Jesus and the authors of the New Testament letters entered in to 2,000 years ago.

A catalyst can be defined as &ldquo;a condition, event, or person that is the cause of an important change.&rdquo; As followers of Jesus, we can either choose to ignore the catalysts in our lives that move us closer to Christ, or we can embrace the messiness of change.

This VIVA! series will have your group examine how catalysts in scripture demonstrate real-life implications for us as they talk and explore.

Week 1: Peter&rsquo;s Vision: What happens when everything you thought was rigid and true opens up into freedom and new possibilities? Explore the vision God gives to Peter in Acts 10 and its complicated results involving supposedly unclean visitors.

Week 2: The Bleeding Woman: Sometimes a catalyst in one&rsquo;s life comes at a low point: a time of isolation, sadness, confusion, or deep need&mdash;yet help may be just an arm&rsquo;s length away.

Week 3: The Rich Young Ruler: When presented with a catalyst, it is entirely possible to ignore it and walk away.

Week 4: Nicodemus: It might do us all a lot of good to look at the long game when it comes to the catalysts in our faith and trust that forward movement, even if slow at times, is still movement toward God.

159444,viva-anxious,"Viva! Anxious","2019-01-11 02:32:51",1,"No matter what study you look at, there is a consensus among mental health experts that anxiety in teens has been increasing over the last decade. Many even suggest that the picture the statistics paint is optimistic based on the stigma associated with being anxious. It can also be debated about the role faith culture plays into the discussion as well: does it increase the stigma or does it help get to the root of the issue?

Regardless of the answer, the fact remains that the issue needs to be discussed. For starters, according to the 2015 Child Mind Institute Children&rsquo;s Mental Health Report roughly 80% of teens who have a diagnosable anxiety disorder are not getting the treatment they really need. Beyond that, with the rise of general feelings of anxiety, we need to create spaces where teens can safely discuss how they feel so that we can help them determine ways to promote healthier living.

Viva! Anxious will help your group dive into this important issue. We&rsquo;ll explore the topic of anxiety so that your teens can recognize what it is, and isn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ll talk about how to deal with anxiety and look at some Scriptures that addresses the issue. Here is what we&rsquo;ll be discussing:

Week 1: The Elephant in the Room

Week 2: Do Not Be Anxious

Week 3: Learning to Be Content

87044,viva-1-john,"Viva! 1 John","2019-01-11 02:27:24",74,"Week 1: Light

Light and darkness are concepts we are all familiar with. Each and every day we see them at work as day turns into night and back into day again. The apostle John uses these concepts to help us understand true fellowship with God and to recognize the ways we fail at that fellowship. This lesson will help us see that a life spent walking in the light is a life of confident living&mdash;because it&rsquo;s a life we know is full of the love God calls us toward.

Week 2: Abide

The concept of &ldquo;abiding&rdquo; in God is a common theme throughout John&rsquo;s writings. But while &ldquo;abiding&rdquo; may be a fairly common word in church contexts, what does it actually mean for the lives of the kids in your community? This lesson will take a look at what John means when he calls followers of Christ to &ldquo;abide,&rdquo; and how abiding will help us remain with Jesus, experiencing the light and love John speaks of.

Week 3: Love

Love is a common theme when it comes to studying the life of Jesus, but John offers a fresh take on this expected word. He calls us to fill our lives up so completely with love that there is little room left for anything else. This lesson will help you and your students to recognize, as John did, that God and love are one and the same.

Week 4: Confidence

Throughout his letter, one of John&rsquo;s key points is that when we abide in Christ&rsquo;s light and love, we can lead a confident life. Despite times when we may have to deal, as John writes, with the hate of others, false things said about Jesus, or even the temptations of our world, ultimately we can still be confident because of Christ&rsquo;s saving grace. In this lesson, we will look at how allowing ourselves to abide with God, full of light and love, also allows us to claim a lasting and deep confidence in who we are as Christ&rsquo;s followers.

need to hear... &ldquo;yes, learn from your mistakes. But it&rsquo;s better to make wise choices.&rdquo; And it all
starts with following Jesus.

&lt;strong&gt;OVERVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;

Are there angels and demons all around us? Does God speak through people speaking gibberish? Are there really places like heaven and hell after we die? There are some strange things in Scripture and it&rsquo;s not very often that we get to address these topics, so we set aside an entire series to talk about the things that make us raise our eyebrows a little bit.

The Unexplainable is a series that helps us explore some of the stranger things we witness in Scripture. People believe many different things regarding these subjects, so let&rsquo;s sit down and work through the key passages of Scripture to seek a better understanding of ourselves, our world, and our God.

&lt;strong&gt;OUTLINE&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Angels and Demons&lt;/strong&gt; // Luke 24:36-43, 4:31-35, Rev. 12:9

&lt;strong&gt;Charismatic Gifts&lt;/strong&gt; // Acts 2:1-4; 1 Cor. 13:1-3

We pick up the narrative as it begins showing God fulfilling his promise to Abram in Genesis 12 which promises to make him a great nation. The trouble is that this great nation is in a foreign land under a harsh tyrant. God remembers his promise, hears the cry of His people and miraculously redeems them our of slavery in Egypt. After calling them out of the bondage of slavery, God gives them direction on how to live covenantally with Him. The last section of Exodus is God&rsquo;s instructions for the Tabernacle. Essentially, God gives them guidance on how to live and respond in worship in the presence of the One who has redeemed them.

Each week is focused on having the gospel at the center of your group's conversations.

&lt;h5&gt;Week 3: Why Missions?&lt;/h5&gt;
We&rsquo;ve dived deep into what it means to live the Salt Life and the Spiritual Warfare that is constantly being waged all around us. There are two weapons we use to fight spiritual battles -- prayer and fasting. One thing we did not discuss is, &ldquo;Why go on a mission trip at all?&rdquo; It is a valid question. We&rsquo;re not missionaries, right?

Scripture: Matthew 28:18-20
&lt;h5&gt;Week 4: What is the Gospel?&lt;/h5&gt;
How can we possibly be expected to spread the Gospel as missionaries and witnesses if we don&rsquo;t know what the Gospel says? I mean &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;know it, too -- if someone came up to you and said, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve never read the Bible, what does it say?&rdquo; -- could you tell them?

If you've played buzzwords in the past, then you'll love this game that is very similar. Instead of getting into groups and making lists over the course of a minute, contestants from teams come up front to see who can have the last word. A category will come up on the screen, such as presidents, and students shout out an answer first. They then take turns, alternating, between giving an answer to that category, until one takes more than 4 seconds or says a wrong answer. (So student A - Clinton, student B - Lincoln, student A - Bush, etc. etc.).

This game comes with 11 categories, so you're guaranteed a tie breaker for rounds. Plus, like all of our games, it comes loaded into a powerpoint so you can download it and play it in your Youth Ministry tonight!","&lt;ul&gt;

God has bestowed his image only on mankind. As image bearers we have a divine responsibility to reflect God&rsquo;s image to the world. God has also made his image bearers distinct as men and women. When we confuse the different roles God has given men and women, we confuse the image God has called us to reflect to the world. This is a 4-week series on the subject of Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. This series focuses on what it means to be a young man or young&nbsp;woman today as students. It doesn&rsquo;t dive into issues of marriage or raising kids because that isn&rsquo;t where most of our students are. This series focuses on what it means to be the young man and young woman God wants them to be today as image bearers. Included are Message Outlines, Graphics, and Slides.

But for teens, it's almost something they live. Most of the students we minister to don't know a world in which they aren't connected to at least one social media network (though they probably don't understand that term).

But there are real dangers in Social Media. Students should absolutely have boundaries, sometimes for specific apps.

In this 4 week Sermon Series for Youth Groups, you'll discuss 3 of the most popular social networks that teens use, Instagram, SnapChat, and Youtube, and take a look at some of the dangers these apps pose. But more importantly, you'll look at what these apps portray about walking with and living for God.

In Week 1, we discuss twitter, and the importance of keeping whats important as important.

In Week 2, we discuss Instagram, and how easy it is to present a life that isn't true, how easy it is for our online presence to be disconnected from the real us.

In Week 3, we discuss Snapchat, and the need to be vulnerable with others while also protecting ourselves, which can be a real fine line.

In Week 4, we discuss YouTube, and the damage that can be done with words.

The name of God is never mentioned in the entire book of Esther, yet you can clearly see Him at work through the book. This 4 week Small Group Curriculum and 4 week Sermon series obviously complement each other perfectly, but they also can be used as stand alone studies.

Through these 4 week studies, your students will read through the book of Esther and gain an in-depth knowledge of the book, as well as important take aways for our lives today, from standing up for what you believe in and taking risks for God, to what it means to walk Humbly with Him.

Doing Youth Group Fundraisers is something that most Youth Pastors is accustomed to, and we&rsquo;re always looking for easier ways of doing it. One of the most commonly done fundraisers with any group of teens is a car wash, but how often do you spend hours upon hours preparing for one, spending the money on the tools to do it, and corral teens for a few hours to actually wash the cars, all to end up with only a few hundred bucks.

With a car wash-a-thon, you can guarantee an increase in your return. We used this method recently with only 13 students, and made over $7500! We can&rsquo;t guarantee you&rsquo;ll make that much, but we do know, this is one of our favorite fundraisers.

You know you have that huge event on your calendar a few months from now, but do your students and parents know about it? It&rsquo;s never too early to start promoting those far away events, and this save the date card is the perfect solution to get the word out with plenty of time.

You can fully customize everything on this card, change the font, change the color, change the text! It works great for Fall Retreat promotion, but it can be any event you want!

The Woman at the well.&nbsp;Matthew at his tax collector booth.&nbsp;The disciples on the road to Emmaus.&nbsp;Peter on his Fishing boat after the crucifixion.

Jesus encountered these, and many more, in moments of complete desperation, at their lowest, while lost. Yet in each of these stories, He redeems them, and sends them to greater things.&nbsp;When we read these four stories, we see them where Jesus finds them, and read about where he sends them.

But how do we get from point A, to point B. How do we get from lost to found? This Sermon series is a great theme to start the new year in January.

This download also contains a 21 day bible reading plan to coincide with the sermon&rsquo;s that you can print as is, or customize for your group.

It also has 3 pages of scripture for personal struggles: Character, Self Image, and Worry. All pages come in PDF and Word format (to add more personal struggles if desired) and are full of scriptures about each topic. Students can easily walk through their prayer time each day using the sheets. I recommend putting them in a 3-ring binder and including notebook paper in between each category to write their prayers and any specific requests to remember each day.

Woke is a slang term derived from the word &ldquo;awake.&rdquo; We use the word awake or awoke when we are talking about physical sleep. &ldquo;I was sleeping, then I awoke.&rdquo; Woke has a similar definition, but instead of talking about physical sleep the slang term is used for awareness on current events, social issues, and injustice. If you were to say to someone, &ldquo;Stay woke!&rdquo; often, you are telling them to stop dreaming or living in a fantasy and see the real world.

The series Stay Woke is intentionally playing off this slang term to encourage students to see how their Christian beliefs are in tension with what the surrounding culture is saying. Every week a topic is presented and we first will look at what our culture tells us and then what Scripture says. Utilizing the tension between our culture and Scripture, we conclude by telling our students to Stay Woke and recognize that Scripture and contemporary culture disagree on some major issues in our life.

Week 2 - Being a friend from Proverbs

48992,speed-gaming,"Speed Gaming","2019-01-11 02:25:04",55,"This is a great ice-breaker if you have a long time to fill, especially with a larger group. The concept is similar to speed dating, but instead of meeting a bunch of people to try and date, players are meeting a bunch of other teens just to have fun playing games! Players will get the chance to quickly connect with as many others as you time for, possibly meeting everyone at your event. The game is a circle of games (board games, card games, &amp;amp; video games... best choices are common, simple games like Checkers, Jenga, Mariokart, scrabble, uno, etc.). Each game has multiple seats, with some seats on a numbered inside loop and some seats on a numbered outside loop. Have everyone take a seat at a game. Do a quick glance at the rules if needed, and then players face off and chat in the short time they have at their game. After a few minutes, a timer goes off and everyone must move one seat in the direction of their loop. Players meet new opponents on a new game (or possibly at a different position on the same game!), pick up where the last player left off, and continue on! Points are scored for completing a game or achieving something special like a Yahtzee or a double jump in checkers. Everyone keeps track of their own scores and creative prizes can be awarded at the end. Plan on 30-75 minutes depending on the size of your group.

Odds are, best friends may have completely different stories to view on snap chat based on who they follow and who they actually interact with. But most likely, our feeds still look very familiar. For whatever reason, you know that over time as you go on social media, you&rsquo;re going to see someone posting about being at a sporting event you aren&rsquo;t at, and you&rsquo;ll see someone posting a picture of their perfectly framed devotional time in the morning, and someone is going to be posting a screenshot of a funny conversation they just had.

Snap that gets your students to race through their feeds to find some of these stereotypical things, and a few not so easy to find ones, in teams to win. It&rsquo;s a super simple game to play and has been a HUGE hit with our groups, because of how simple it is 'Find this in someones story, and show it to a leader.'

Sex is a similar thing, a sacred, intimate space given to us by God with purposeful designs, helping us live out who we are made to be, and to be used for God's glory and not our own gain.

Each week steps into a delicate conversation, providing you a sermon manuscript, small group questions, recommended reading, screen backgrounds and instagram graphics. Also included is a parent letter that you can modify and send out to help explain the teaching that is going to be covered.

Last year, we sold this great T-shirt and it was a huge hit as the perfect gift for Youth Ministry volunteers. We brought last year's design back, on a higher quality shirt for this year, for those interested.

This shirt makes a great gift for Youth Ministry volunteers, Small Group Leaders, Church staff and Youth Pastors. It's&nbsp;printed on a&nbsp;premium soft crew neck, weighing 4.3oz is a blend of 60% cotton and 40% polyester, meaning this will be one of the softest t-shirts you'll ever wear. Plus, the design this year will be printed with a water based ink, meaning it won't be a hard glob of hard ink on the front of the shirt, but a part of the fabric.

We don't want to say last year's T-Shirts were bad, but&nbsp;we've improved the quality of the shirt by leaps and bounds.

Plus, when you order the shirt, get a free customizable Business Card to download, editable in photoshop&nbsp;to download.

A lemon describes someone or something that is defective or not useful. The Christian life often gets mistaken for simply a list of &ldquo;don&rsquo;ts&rdquo;:
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Don&rsquo;t watch this show.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Don&rsquo;t say that word.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Don&rsquo;t be mean to others.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Don&rsquo;t punt that kitten&hellip;wait what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The Christian life is SO much more. We have been invited into God&rsquo;s story, welcomed into His Kingdom, and called a son or daughter to DO things for the glory of Christ. In John 15 Jesus tells His followers, &ldquo;I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide (16).&rdquo; If you are a follower of Jesus, then you have been chosen and appointed to bear fruit. Now, what does it mean to bear fruit? Fruit is the results of your actions and as a result good fruit only comes from those who abide (rest, live, obey, trust) in Christ (John 15:4-5).

The Christian life is not a useless or defective life, rather is one that is seen by the fruit our lives bear. &lt;em&gt;Produce&lt;/em&gt; aims to teach students the importance of living a life that glorifies God by producing the fruit of the Spirit.","&lt;ul&gt;

But what does that actually look like?

Too often, we can get caught up in the busyness of ministry that we don't do the things we want to do, that we know we should do - like partner with parents.

There is far more to partnering with parents than just this resource, but this kit goes a long way in helping us move our ministries from simply sending home a newsletter informing parents of what we're doing, to a place where we are building connections and ministry moments with parents.

This download comes with 5 trench tested, pre-made emails that are ready to go for different situations that come up all the time in youth ministry. But more than just ready to go emails for parents, it's a guide meant to help you enhance your overall email strategy, and tailor fit your why and how behind the emails to make them really work for you.

184613,parent-chats,"Parent Chats","2019-01-11 02:34:27",74,"I'm a big believer that one of the best things a Youth Pastor can do for the growth of their student ministry is keep open lines of communication with Parents. It's just way to easy to see that the long-term health of a group is connected to parent buy-in.

One way to keep great communication with parents is to simply call them! In today's day, we'd much rather text, but calls are a lot easier and take only a minute or so, and go a long way with building greater parent connections.

This resource is designed to help you do that, even using an easy and natural cause for the call - transitions. With spring coming, you've got a handful of students who will be moving from 5th grade into your middle school ministry, students moving from 8th to 9th grade, and students graduating. If you called no one else but these parents, you'd still see a great return on the investment of time!

So download this pack of parent chats! It contains 5 total scripts you can easily edit and customize, and use yourself as well as pass on to your leaders to use as well. Scripts for students transitioning in or out of your ministry, for families who visit your church on Sunday, and a letter template to send to parents introducing yourself!

154542,parables,Parables,"2019-01-11 02:31:41",13,"When you read through the Gospel accounts in Scripture, you inevitably encounter a parable and ask the question, &ldquo;Why does Jesus teach like this?&rdquo; Around one-third of Jesus&rsquo; teaching is in parables. Parables seem to trip every reader up and not only wonder &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Jesus taught like this, but &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; Jesus meant by His parables. If you have ever wanted a deeper understanding of Jesus&rsquo; parables, then this is a great starting point for you to begin understanding and applying the great parables of Jesus Christ.

&lt;u&gt;What&rsquo;s a parable?&lt;/u&gt;

A parable has a very broad meaning in Scripture. A parable can be a proverb (Luke 4:23), a riddle (Mk 3:23), a comparison (Mt 13:33), a contrast (Lk 18:1&ndash;8) and both simple stories (Lk 13:6&ndash;9) and complex stories (Mt 22:1&ndash;14). This broad term is used by Jesus as his primary way on teaching about the Kingdom of God, or heaven, and the character of God. A parable is characterized by an example that elicits thought by placing examples side by side to illustrate a point.

SERIES OVERVIEW
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Parable of the Sower&lt;/strong&gt; // Matthew 13:10-13&lt;/li&gt;

159405,next-why-jesus,"Next: Why Jesus?","2019-01-11 02:32:33",1,"?
We know teenagers wrestle with questions such as:

Was Jesus even a real person?
Did Jesus really claim he was God?
How is Jesus different than other &ldquo;wise&rdquo; teachers?
Why did people follow Jesus?
Is Jesus actually important to the Christian faith?
In this edition of Next, Why Jesus?, we&rsquo;ll help your students process these questions.

A note from the writing team about Why Jesus?&ndash;

Right up front, we have to say that this topic is really big and difficult to rightly handle. We hope to see our students grasp the importance of Jesus within the larger story of God&rsquo;s extravagant love for us. God in the flesh, Jesus, comes to earth to reveal himself further to humanity is a story that at once gives us goosebumps and brings us to a place of repentant gratitude. &ldquo;For God so loved the world&rdquo; echoes throughout time and space as a calling into this amazing relationship with that same God and the freedom of a life in Christ.

Keep in mind that the teachings tend toward an oversimplification of many of the issues that Christian apologists do cover with more depth. We cannot possibly touch on every aspect of why Jesus is so important to the Christian faith, but what we can do we have done. We are greatly influence by the likes of N.T. Wright, Ravi Zacharias, Lee Strobel and others. You may also notice that we have left out Jesus as the propitiation for sin in this lesson, mostly because we feel that this is a topic unto itself and could not possibly be handled within the framework of the other burning questions our students have concerning Jesus. The main issues addressed by us are the exclusive claims of Jesus, the historicity of Jesus, the importance of the resurrection, and the incarnation of Christ.

We strongly recommend that you create a box where students can write down and submit questions as you go along. It&rsquo;s very likely they will be addressed at some point in the series, but this way you will know where your students are at in the process and you can tailor the lessons to them.

We are sure you can add to this list. We also know that there are no pat answers to any of these questions that will satisfy students long term. The most effective way to answer them is to allow students to experience the truth for themselves through a number of means. We strongly recommend that the curriculum prompts that include scripture, prayer, and discussion be utilized, but all that is up to you.

One of our foundational beliefs is that the Holy Spirit does the work of convincing. We encourage you and your team to lean into that belief as well. Our job is not to argue anyone into the Kingdom or to berate another&rsquo;s beliefs, but to present better questions, the testimony of people, and the scriptures.

About Next

Long gone are the days of shallow and pat answers that have been common in our teaching. Students today live in a complex world and our teaching must rise to the occasion and help guide them through the maze of culture&rsquo;s complexities. Brock Morgan, along with this dream team of authors and thinkers, have put together what we believe is NEXT in youth ministry teaching and engagement. Through, in a more holistic manner, addressing the topics that are key in a student&rsquo;s burgeoning faith we have crafted a series that will direct investigation and appeal to the heart. Connected to The Amazing Next Conference, this series is meant to empower students and to help them have a sustainable faith that lasts; a faith that is thoughtful and engaged in what God is doing in the world.

159413,next-why-church,"Next: Why Church?","2019-01-11 02:32:35",1,"If you are aware of the statistics that have gone around the last few years, you are probably as troubled by the Church drop out rate as we are.  Our students are finding that the local body of believers is often at odds with their rapidly shifting culture.  Once they begin to experience life outside the Christian &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; of their childhood, they begin to realize that the world is a diverse and highly relational place.  This section of curriculum tackles two issues for our students: The relational realities of their world which is in seeming conflict with the Church and the purpose of the Church community in their lives.

First, our students actually know someone who is gay, they are friends with someone who is Muslim, they are smart enough to see what war does to entire people groups.  They have relational skin in this game and are becoming more and more aware of the lack of compassion that seems to spew from those who speak for the American Church in the news.

The second issue many of them face is that their church does not usher them into adulthood, but rather ignores them and relegates them to the youth ministry.  They do not feel part of something bigger than themselves, with purpose and meaning they can buy into. As a result they are not seeking to be a part of a Church community until years after high school graduation or sometimes not at all.

We hope that the scriptures found in these lessons will bring about a counter cultural revolution in your group.  The teachings of Jesus were revolutionary in his own day and carry the same weight in these uncertain times.  And, let&rsquo;s face it, loving God with our whole being and loving others well is stinking hard.  But we believe our students are up for the challenge and the Church should be both the launching pad and home base for those desiring to live a flourishing life in Christ.

159415,next-the-gospel-reframed,"Next: The Gospel Reframed","2019-01-11 02:32:39",1,"The word &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; has drifted a long way from its original meaning or has almost no meaning to today&rsquo;s youth. All too often we speak of the gospel to students when they have no real understanding of the term or the theological framework it sits in. Because we, as followers of Jesus, acknowledge the transformative power of the gospel we feel compelled to make the gospel accessible to this generation.

If the gospel is so powerful, what is it that makes it so? What does it mean to a student, or anyone, living in this day and age? What, if anything, makes it &ldquo;good&rdquo;? These are the questions that we hope to address in this curriculum as we paint a picture of the term &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; within its context and hold it up as a beacon of hope to those living today.

We also pray that your students will go through this curriculum gaining a better understanding of the gospel for themselves, for humanity, and for all of creation. We believe that the gospel is, in an age where there are so many competing philosophies and religions, just as valid and relevant today as it was for the first won converts.

You may notice what some would see as a gaping hole in this curriculum on the gospel &ndash; the topic of hell. Though hell is scriptural, we are convinced that it has been overemphasized and mishandled by well-meaning teachers to either scare students into heaven or pressure them into evangelizing out of fear. Personally, what brought me into abundant life in Christ was not hell, but God&rsquo;s incredible love and forgiveness -God&rsquo;s amazing Grace. We, instead, choose to come from a Kingdom of God framework that emphasizes the overarching purpose and plan of God for humanity and the world. Ephesians 1: 9-10 (NIV) says it this way:

&ldquo;&hellip;he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment&mdash;to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.&rdquo;

We strongly recommend that you create a box where students can write down and submit questions as you go along. It&rsquo;s very likely they will be addressed at some point in the series, but this way you will know where your students are at in the process and you can tailor the lessons to them.

Students today live in a complex world and our teaching must rise to the occasion and help guide them through the maze of culture&rsquo;s complexities. Brock Morgan, along with this dream team of authors and thinkers, have put together what we believe is NEXT in youth ministry teaching and engagement. Through, in a more holistic manner, addressing the topics that are key in a student&rsquo;s burgeoning faith we have crafted a series that will direct investigation and appeal to the heart. Connected to The Amazing Next Conference, this series is meant to empower students and to help them have a sustainable faith that lasts; a faith that is thoughtful and engaged in what God is doing in the world.

159417,next-supernatural,"Next: Supernatural","2019-01-11 02:32:40",1,"Students today are searching. They are searching for ways to explain the unexplainable, define the undefinable, and put words and methods to a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, words that we can hardly grasp. In a time where we worship a wanderlust mentality, how do we settle down long enough to form a foundational faith in something we cannot see?

These four weeks we&rsquo;re going to talk about where our society is today on the topic of engaging the supernatural. What is easy to believe and what is hard to believe? Why are we searching, and what are we ultimately searching for? Then we&rsquo;ll talk about how we might be more supernatural than we have ever really understood, what exactly makes God &ldquo;super natural&rdquo;, and how we can reconcile ourselves to him in the midst of it all.

In a day where anything goes, every belief is acceptable, and anything can have power, how do we know who has the real power?

We encourage you to spend time during the first week finding out where your students are at on this topic. What have they encountered in their search, or their friends&rsquo; search for understanding and faith? Meet them there.

We strongly recommend that you create a box where students can write down and submit questions as you go along. It&rsquo;s very likely they will be addressed at some point in the series, but this way you will know where your students are at in the process and you can tailor the lessons to them.

We are sure you can add to this list. We also know that there are not pat answers to any of these questions that will satisfy students long term. The most effective way to answer them is to allow students to experience the truth for themselves through a number of means. We strongly recommend that the curriculum prompts that include scripture, prayer, and discussion be utilized, but all that is up to you.

One of our foundational beliefs is that the Holy Spirit does the work of convincing. We encourage you and your team to lean into that belief as well. Our job is not to argue anyone into the Kingdom or to berate another&rsquo;s beliefs, but to present better questions, the testimony of people, and the scriptures.

The narrative today seems to suggest that science and faith are in conflict. This lesson focuses on exploring the reality that if we take the time to deeply understand science and faith, we can learn the ways in which they complement and differ from each other. We want to help students navigate the felt tension between science and faith guided by Scripture, discussion, and God&rsquo;s spirit.

Some of the most pertinent questions are:

Can I love science and love God?
Does science disprove Christianity?
Why does the church seem to hate scientific facts?
Do I have to choose between science and faith?

How do I have a conversation with someone when I don&rsquo;t understand their point of view?
Am I impacted by my culture&rsquo;s attitudes about race?
What, if anything, can I do about racism?
Whew! There is no way to address this topic adequately, especially in the limited time and space we have on a youth group night. Hopefully Eniitan&rsquo;s lessons and stories will help spark conversation and so much compassion among your students. We truly believe that the next generation will have a better handle on this than those that have come before, but it is important to connect their faith with the cry of the marginalized. Unity, not sameness, is the crux of the early church. Our faith is one in which every tribe, tongue, and nation come together through the equalizing and transformative power of Jesus Christ.

Edition Author

Eniitan &ldquo;Eni&rdquo; Coker is a first generation Nigerian-American born as the youngest of 7 kids and raised by a dynamic and God-loving Nigerian mother in the deep South of the U.S. &ldquo;Eni-&rdquo; translates to person and &ldquo;-itan&rdquo; is equivalent to the English words history or story. All together, Eniitan is by name a &ldquo;person with a history&rdquo; or &ldquo;child of story&rdquo; and by practice, a storyteller. Her nuanced upbringing in Georgia as a Nigerian raised in African-American culture but consistently positioned in predominately white environments is woven into the narratives of the curriculum. Eni&rsquo;s calling to youth ministry that led her to the Northern Virginia has allowed her unexpected opportunities to explore what God has to say about issues of race, class, socioeconomic status and multi-ethnic ministry. This curriculum stems out of lived experiences, racial literacy courses, shared narratives, uncomfortable conversations, heart-breaking memories and hope-filled vision that has been held up to the word of God and the nature God.

159409,next-gifted-called,"Next: Gifted &amp; Called","2019-01-11 02:32:34",1,"Our students are extraordinary! We believe that this is true, even in the midst of their pain, mistakes, and general adolescent drama. And that is the beauty of our gracious God- the he not only can use us for his glory, but he has chosen to give gifts to his people so that they can be fully alive as his image bearers. As students learn that they are called to join God here on earth in his master plan to renew and restore all things, we hope that they will begin to value themselves, their decisions, and the rest of humanity.

Our students will wrestle with questions such as:

How do I define success?
What am I passionate about?
What does God want me to be or do?
What are my gifts?
During this series we will introduce the term &ldquo;Royal Priesthood&rdquo; to the students. This may seem a bit archaic, but it might also resonate with stories from popular culture that seem to capture the imagination. If students are really ready for a life worth living and are tired of sitting in rows and only hearing about the faith, then this is a title that will stir their hearts and minds. We draw from the picture of Jesus, the servant King and Priest, who we are still talking about and emulating over 2000 years later. We call students into their role as co-heirs with Jesus, partners in making all things new in the here and now.

We have given you several tests and inventories to have your students fill out and immediately you might think, &ldquo;Yuck! Tests!&rdquo; Before you toss these out consider that it is our experience that kids love anything that is about themselves, so we encourage you to do your best to lead them through this process. So much of our relationship and how we connect with God has to do with our identity and personality, and so it is fun to explore this arena with students.

The great news is that you can refer back to these. Spend extra time where you feel they are resonating and We strongly recommend that you create a box where students can write down and submit questions as you go along. It&rsquo;s very likely they will be addressed at some point in the series, but this way you will know where your students are at in the process and you can tailor the lessons to them.

With the advent of the internet, we are able to see our world in a whole new light. The problems that we used to be aware of in our neighborhoods, communities, states, or nation have now paled in comparison to the evil and suffering found in the world that we are now able to access. This poses a specific set of questions for young people about God&rsquo;s role in the world and in their own life. These questions, if not expressed in a loving and faith filled community can become stumbling blocks in the growth of a teen&rsquo;s faith.

Some of the most pertinent questions are:

Why would a loving God allow people to suffer?
Why doesn&rsquo;t God make evil people stop what they are doing?
There are so many terrible things going on in the world, how can I make a difference?
If God allows evil to exist in the world, does that make him evil too?

96871,next-a-dismissed-faith,"Next: A Dismissed Faith","2019-01-11 02:28:21",1,"In September of 2006 George Barna sent a shockwave through the Church and particularly youth ministries. The study released by the Barna Group stated that &ldquo;61% of today&rsquo;s young adults . . . had been churched at one point during their teen years but they are now spiritually disengaged (i.e., not actively attending church, reading the Bible, or praying). Only one-fifth of twenty-somethings (20%) have maintained a level of spiritual activity consistent with their high school experiences.&rdquo; (source) The statistic is shocking and disheartening to churches that purport to be making disciples. Barna goes on to report, &ldquo;Another one-fifth of teens (19%) were never significantly reached by a Christian community of faith during their teens and have remained disconnected from the Christian faith.&rdquo; There have been other follow-up studies that are providing more in-depth information. The &ldquo;Soul Searching&rdquo; study was completed by Christian Smith and The National Study of Youth and Religion. The Sticky Faith Study was completed by Kara Powell and the Center for Youth and Family Ministries through Fuller Seminary. Each have had follow ups and are asking the question: Why are teens walking away from faith?

Our faith is steeped in both intellectual assent and mystery, so it is no wonder that our students are questioning the validity of having faith in Christ. Those who lean into the intellect struggle with the mystery and those who lean toward spirituality miss the ancient historical narrative that grounds the Christian faith. We believe that students need to embrace both realms in a more holistic manner in order to have flourishing life in Christ. But let&rsquo;s be honest: none of this is new.

There are age old questions that every follower of Jesus has had to grapple with:

What do we really know about Jesus?
How do I have faith when everyone around me is saying it is just a crutch or so flawed that it is stupid to believe?
Why do I even need God?

This is a great strategy for helping students get connected to the group, to a leader, learn about small groups, and move from brand new Christian to having a good understanding of what that means, and this session of discussions will help students learn how grow their faith and take practical steps in learning how to pray and how to study the Bible.

1question may not seem like much, but it's designed to lead to further discussion. What we DIDN'T want was to have leaders sitting in starbucks with a stack of papers they are reading, never looking at the student. We aimed for one focus for the week that would give a general framework for the conversation, that is part of a larger plan to help move students from point A to point B in their spiritual Journey.

This specific pack is a 12 week pack of conversation guides to help students discuss faith and grow in their walk with God. These aren't lengthy discussion guides, but rather, a little bit of prep for leaders revolving around 1 question to discuss with a student in a one on one setting.

&lt;strong&gt;In this download pack:&lt;/strong&gt;

12 weeks designed for students who have recently accepted Christ. This is a great strategy for helping students get connected to the group, to a leader, learn about small groups, and move from brand new Christian to having a good understanding of what that means.

Now, 1 question may not seem like much, but it's designed to lead to further discussion. What we DIDN'T want was to have leaders sitting in starbucks with a stack of papers they are reading, never looking at the student. We aimed for one focus for the week that would give a general framework for the conversation, that is part of a larger plan to help move students from point A to point B in their spiritual Journey.

This resource is a great tool for your ministry, either as is or as a starting board for something else.&nbsp;It's reproducible and reusable over and over again and a great investment for any size youth ministry.","&lt;ul&gt;

Throughout the Old Testament, God receives multiple proper names. &nbsp;In almost every instance where God is given a name, the circumstances are miraculous and teach us something powerful about the character and provision of our God. &nbsp;Jehovah Jireh (The Lord Provides) was given when God provided a ram for Abraham's sacrifice instead of Isaac. &nbsp;Jehovah Rapha (The Lord Heals) was given when God healed the water at Marah so the Israelites could drink. &nbsp;These stories are just a taste of what the Names of God series will communicate to your students.

&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;11 Big Group Lessons (10 weeks + recap) - full editable manuscripts (Microsoft Word and PDF formats)&lt;/li&gt;

But the Bible identifies who we are in Christ. This series seeks to help students battle against some of the major issues that are facing Generation Z, feeding them a false image, and help them stand secure in their identity.

&lt;strong&gt;Week 1&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on our value found in God, and seen through Christ's death.

&lt;strong&gt;Week 2&lt;/strong&gt; helps us battle against wanting to be accepted by others, showing us that our acceptance is found in Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Week 3&lt;/strong&gt; looks at our need to belong, but that the greatest belonging is found in Christ. But, we also understand that following Jesus shows us that there are times we will never belong in the world.

&lt;strong&gt;Week 4&lt;/strong&gt; examines our purpose, that is found only in knowing God and keeping His commands.

And the final week will look at the way Scripture identifies us as followers of Christ and the blessings that come from being found in Him.

This series is complete with graphics for teaching, as well as full manuscripts with notes and suggested illustrations in both Pages and .doc format.

This game can work with selected contestants or the entire group.

Pro-Tip: use the included printable cards with the Marvel logo and Meh for DC on for students to hold up the correct answer. This helps reduce the amount of cheating that can occur. Or they students can hold up an &quot;M&quot; like in signing the YMCA for Marvel or shrug their shoulders for Meh. Another option would be to use the provided answer sheets for the entire group to use at once (Note: you'll need to rearrange the slides to make this happen - all questions and then the answers).

'Week 1 - The Original Wonderland' is focused on the perfect world Adam and Eve had in Genesis 2, and why that's important.
'Week 2 - Wonderland Lost' is all about the fall of man in Genesis 3, and the implication it has for us as a human race.
'Week 3 - Wonderland 2.0' is all about the work that Jesus did on the Cross to reverse the curse of sin and death and allow us to enter into Wonderland 2.0 - heaven!

The manuscript for each week is around 2,500 words.

I pray that this series will be a blessing to you and your group. Have fun with it!

With all that students go through in life, they can face some really difficult situations. And too often, the church response is, 'hey, cheer up, Jesus loves you.' But what about the safety and permission to hurt? What about the God who comforts and is close to the brokenhearted? Here are four messages that look through the darker side of life, and where hope comes breaking through.

&lt;strong&gt;Light Breaking Through&lt;/strong&gt;: a 4 Week series called 'Light Breaking Through' all about finding hope in the darkest places in our lives.

The issue of faith and science is one that the church has not had a great history with; it&rsquo;s one of the main reasons young people give for leaving the faith after high school. Using some of the latest research, as well as quotes from the Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy and Doctor Who, this series attempts to give students a new framework for reconciling faith and science, while at the same time exploring the core message of scripture.
Week One, &ldquo;The Ultimate Question,&rdquo; challenges students to consider whether we are asking the right questions of scripture when we address the topic of faith and science. This message also addresses the core purpose of scripture: to guide us to God.
Week Two, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Panic,&rdquo; takes a deep look at Genesis 1, four different theories of origin, and how Christians can approach Genesis 1 in a way that honors God.
Week Three, &ldquo;Mostly Harmless,&rdquo; explores Genesis 2, the creation of Adam and Eve, the Garden of Eden, and what scripture teaches us about the nature of humanity and its origins.
This series draws heavily on current research and Biblical experts for guidance. It is not a series that advocates for one approach to interpretation (e.g., young earth, old earth, etc.), rather, it challenges listeners to a different path, one in which we can have unity in faith while having different approaches to questions regarding science.

There is one criminal that is focused on the world and doesn't believe or trust Jesus, on the other side of Jesus there is a criminal that is equally as sinful yet there is one major difference, he trusts Jesus, he chooses to follow Jesus. What is Jesus' response to him?

King of Kings compares attributes of God to things the world offers to show that only God is worthy of sitting on the throne of our hearts and minds, to rule as the King above all kings in our life. Each message relies heavily upon biblical truths to show how God alone is worthy of Honor, how God alone is truly Constant, how God alone is Eternal, and how God alone is truly vital to life.

Small Group lessons with this&nbsp;series were designed as an element before the message, so rather than finish the sermon, they prepare the hearts of the students for the content of the message, and were written so anyone could lead a group, whether a Seminary student or a High Schooler.

- Four 2-page small group guides
- WEEK 1 -&nbsp;The starting point for a killer new year is a right view of God.
- WEEK 2 -&nbsp;You can't have a killer new year by yourself.

Who loves Christmas? Not a grinch! Have you ever noticed that we all have potential to be a grinch. Through this series you&rsquo;ll help students wrestle down what could be at the root of their grinchiness and help them lose that grinch stench by taking some God honoring next steps. I wonder who will end up on your students &ldquo;give&rdquo; list this year? This was a student favorite series for us.

Week 1: The Heart
Week 2: Greed
Week 3: Kindness

This series includes:
- Title &amp;amp; empty graphic slides
- Jpegs of pre-made talk slides if you don&rsquo;t want to change anything at all in the talk. You can just throw them into your presenter software and be done.
- Talk-notes with graphics and fill-ins are in pdf or pages format only. Many of our students/parents have come to really appreciate these. I print them double sided, on cardstock, and use a corner rounder to round all 4 corners. It turns out looking pretty nice ;)
- Twitter/Facebook Banner
- Instagram Countdown Posts (i.e. 3days until...) to build anticipation
- Instagram re-cap posts: either a scripture or main idea from the previous week. It helps the message to stick throughout the week.
- Some weeks include videos/prop ideas and/or response moments
- Small group discussion questions or more cards really. We&rsquo;ve found it helpful to put each question on a card #1-#8. Print them out. And pass them around the group. The cards more lead the discussion than the small group leader which we&rsquo;ve found to be extremely helpful in building true discussion.
- BONUS Flapjacks &amp;amp; Flannels Event: graphics &amp;amp; game ideas that could be used any of the weeks to enhance the fun level of the series.

PS. I&rsquo;m not an English teacher. If you&rsquo;re looking for grammatical or spelling errors, you&rsquo;ll find them occasionally.","This series includes:
- ready to go slides

● In the beginning, God CREATED all things and saw that it was good.
● Humanity SINNED, bringing about tragic spiritual, physical, and relational consequences
● The Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to RESCUE the broken.
● We live, HERE AND NOW, by loving Him and loving others.
● Our HOPE is in Jesus&rsquo; promise to return to make all things new.

&lt;em&gt;For many students, high school is the first point in life where we begin asking some of life&rsquo;s biggest questions and not just trusting what we have been told. Often this comes from meeting a friend with different beliefs or a teacher teaches something different, but a lot of times we don&rsquo;t go to the right starting point in answering some of these critical questions. In order to ask a question, like the ultimate purpose in life, we must first begin how we view our life. &lt;/em&gt;

But throughout the Bible, there are so many times when people in communication with God doubt him, and what we find is that through it, they grow their faith in amazing ways.

This 3 week small group curriculum will have your students and leaders take a look at 3 people in the Bible who doubted God, and help your students know that it's ok to have doubts, but it's not healthy to never wrestle with them. Your groups will be studying about doubting Thomas, and how Jesus responds to him, as well as Gideon doubting God's plans for his life and Sarah doubting God's ability to do what he says he will do.",,draft,Uncategorized,,15.00,https://s3.amazonaws.com/YouthMin/Ben/Small+Group+lessons/DoubtSmallGroup.zip,-1,,,,0,0

This is a resource designed to give your leaders tools for mentoring students. This specific pack is a 10 week pack of conversation guides to help students discuss faith and grow in their walk with God. These aren't lengthy discussion guides, but rather, a little bit of prep for leaders revolving around 1 question to discuss with a student in a one on one setting.

Now, 1 question may not seem like much, but it's designed to lead to further discussion. What we DIDN'T want was to have leaders sitting in starbucks with a stack of papers they are reading, never looking at the student. We aimed for one focus for the week that would give a general framework for the conversation, that is part of a larger plan to help move students from point A to point B in their spiritual Journey.

It&rsquo;s not hard to find someone who has a conflicting view of something that you hold, but if you can&rsquo;t then just go to comments on a YouTube video on that topic.

We are surrounded by a thousand different views, so what do we know what to believe? How do we determine who is right and who is wrong? Can we even be sure that we are right? In &ldquo;Conflicting Views,&rdquo; we teach on some of the hot button issues in our culture. Our hope is not to win an argument, but to know what Scripture says and to help formalize our beliefs amid conflicting views.

In this message, my goal was to show my students a quick glimpse of what true Christianity looked like in the book of Acts and then show them stories of it being lived out in everyday lives of normal people. I ended with a challenge, challenging them to seek God in prayer and in His Word.

Overall, this message was well received and I have witnessed changes in some of their actions. I pray this one-off lesson will serve as a good challenge lesson for all of you out there.

How you fill in that space tells a lot about a person. Who you listen to says a lot about how you'll fill it in. The students in our Youth Ministries get a lot of messages on what love is from the world around them, what are they getting from the church?

This 5 week (easily 6 week) series takes a look at 5 statements with blank spaces that students must decide between how the world fills them in, or how God fills them in. These statements cover issues like the above, what is Love, as well as taking a look at God's view of dating, God's idea for sex, and what we should look for in who we date/marry if we wish to Honor God. We did extensive Biblical Research to prepare these messages, we hit tough topics and difficult conversations head on, and we draw some clear lines between what the world offers and what God's word says.

This package contains 5 weeks, each with a message transcript and a full discussion guide for break out groups/small groups after the lesson. We did this as a 6 week series with a Relationship Panel as week 6, so that's how you make it a 6 week series, but we can't make our panelists downloadable, so you only get 5 weeks.

In this game, students must deduct how tall or long a famous thing is using bananas. For instance, the average banana length is 7 inches, and Russell Wilson is 5'10&quot;, or 70&quot;, therefore, Russell Wilson is 10 bananas long.

&lt;h5&gt;Here's what Youth Workers who bought last year's bundle had to say about:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like you advertise, years of curriculum, games, files, etc etc. I mean a small church could buy this and have everything covered for the next 2-4 youth pastors they hire and fire yearly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - Matt Price&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is me because I just got the end of the year bundle deal! I'm stoked to use the t-shirt designs, parent talks, and games. This deal is better than striking gold at a garage sale. You can quote me on tha&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;t&nbsp;🙌 - Kenan Klein

&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If money is an issue, beg your leadership for a $100 Christmas gift to the youth ministry. Why? I'll tell you why. As I'm currently downloading the bundle, I'm realizing just how MASSIVE this bundle is compared to years past. I thought last year's was substantial - and it was. But this year's is ridiculous.&nbsp;Seriously, MASSIVE is the only word to describe this bundle.&nbsp;Your future self will THANK YOU TREMENDOUSLY for getting this bundle. -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Terry Bennett

&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a great purchase. There is so much in it from calendar templates to teaching series. There is a guide on using Instagram to promote your ministry and different things you can do to grab the attention of your students. I highly recommend purchasing this and future bundles. Youthmin always has a great bundle and for a fantastic price.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - Chris Sanford

&lt;/div&gt;

We get lost in the parties, present buying, and school schedule craziness only to look up and we are celebrating the New Year. What if this year was different? What would it look like for your family this year to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ together? Let&rsquo;s fight against the December craze by celebrating Advent together.

Advent is an annual season in the month of December when the Church celebrates the coming of Jesus two millennia ago. The English word &ldquo;Advent&rdquo; is formed from the latin word Adventus (that would be an awesome superhero name&hellip;just saying), which means &ldquo;arrival.&rdquo; Through Advent we cheerfully reflect on Jesus&rsquo; first coming and rest in our hopeful expectation of His promised second-coming.

The Advent season is our time to prepare our hearts and minds to celebrate Jesus coming to us. For centuries, Christians have celebrated Advent in many ways - lighting candles, hanging wreaths, giving gifts, reading Scripture, and singing songs. Simply put, Advent is for adoring Jesus. Our goal here is simple: this year we want you to celebrate Advent together as a family by gathering together five times around God&rsquo;s Word.

WHAT IS ADVENT?
Advent is probably a new word for a lot of you in this room, but don&rsquo;t let this scare you. Advent is an annual season in the month of December where the Church celebrates the coming of Jesus two millennia ago. The Advent season begins four Sundays before Christmas and ends on Christmas Eve. The English word &lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Advent&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; is formed from the latin word &lt;em&gt;Adventus&lt;/em&gt; (that would be an awesome superhero name&hellip;just saying), which means &ldquo;coming.&rdquo; Through Advent we &lt;u&gt;cheerfully reflect&lt;/u&gt; on Jesus&rsquo; first coming and rest in our&lt;u&gt; hopeful expectation&lt;/u&gt; of His promised second-coming.

We believe that a solid foundation of Theology is&nbsp;a critical component to help students develop in our Student Ministries. We try and ensure that every message we deliver, or every discussion our small groups have,&nbsp;contains plenty of doctrine in a way teenagers can hold on to.

But,&nbsp;we also know that a student could hear every sermon and be in every small group and still not grasp the entirety of doctrine. So we developed a year long class for students to go through that would lay out doctrine in a way that makes it important for them, easy to understand, but ultimately, helps them know what they believe.

We use this class as a sort of non-denominational confirmation, and we advertise it as being as hard as it is, and it has become a bit of a right of passage for 8th grade students to complete. We cover 20 topics, one topic a week, and have quizzes on the material we go through, as well as a 'Final' examination at the end of the year.

Some of the topics covered include:

what is the bible?

what is god like?

what is the trinity?

what are angels, satan, &amp;amp; demons?

what are&nbsp;justification and Sanctification?

what will happen when christ returns?

And although we use it as a Sunday Morning class, it could just as easily be a class that meets on a weeknight, or you could take our 4 week chunks to mix in with another curriculum.

The goal of the game is to guess the movie title before anyone else. We&rsquo;ve provided you with 3 one word clues, but they won&rsquo;t show up all at once. Every 5 seconds a new clue will reveal itself, so if you think you know the answer before the other people, buzz in and claim the point.

Once you hit the buzzer, the person running slides will pause the countdown(that way the person can&rsquo;t stall while more clues are revealed) If you get it wrong you cannot score anymore, leaving the question open for someone else to steal the point.If the timer runs out(15 secs) than no one scores that round.

Set Up: You&rsquo;ll need 2 or more combatants, a program that can run video presentation(powerpoint, pro presenter, proclaim, etc), and a buzzer(optional).

Should we seek after a significant other? When do we know that we are ready to go out on a date or to enter into a serious relationship? The world of dating as a teenager is really confusing and sadly it doesn&rsquo;t get any easier as you get older.

Dating is difficult. It&rsquo;s difficult because it involves two broken people entering a relationship that more than likely will end up broken off. Broken people create broken relationships that result in breaking up. Is that a pessimistic outlook enough for you?

The hope of this series is not to just warn you about the perils of dating, but to provide your students with an understanding of what it means to date as a Christian. This is coming from an angle that it is probably not best for you to date in high school, BUT if you do date then there is a right way and a wrong way to navigate a relationship.

&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before the First Date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

God has bestowed his image only on mankind. As image bearers we have a divine responsibility to reflect God&rsquo;s image to the world. God has also made his image bearers distinct as men and women. When we confuse the different roles God has given men and women, we confuse the image God has called us to reflect to the world. This is a 4-week series on the subject of Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. This series focuses on what it means to be a young man or young&nbsp;woman today as students. It doesn&rsquo;t dive into issues of marriage or raising kids because that isn&rsquo;t where most of our students are.

&lt;strong&gt;The Walking Dead &ndash; 4 week Sermon Series + Extras&nbsp;&ndash; (Normally $15)&lt;/strong&gt;

Zombies at Youth Group?

Some might not think this is a great topic for a Youth Series, but we think the idea of zombies is a perfect analogy for several areas of our spiritual lives.&nbsp;Over the three week Sermon series, you&rsquo;ll discuss how, similar to zombies, we are only shadows of what we were intended to be, how we hurt others without knowing why, and how we easily blend into the crowd.

This package also contains 3 weeks of questions to use in Small Groups to coincide with the sermons, prepared on great leader guide sheets to give your leaders a quick rundown of what they should focus on in their lesson.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve also thrown in a great event guide for an awesome Zombie Attack game to use as a separate event or as part of a Youth Group Lock-in.

&lt;strong&gt;Reverse Charades &ndash; Christmas Edition&nbsp;&ndash; (Normally $3)&lt;/strong&gt;

This simple calendar is pretty easy to edit, regardless of your photoshop expertise, &nbsp;and looks great.&nbsp;This calendar only shows two months at a time, but is designed to be printed front and back to more prominently display event information.

&lt;strong&gt;Esther &ndash; 4 Week Small Group + 4 week Sermon series&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&ndash; (Normally $18)&lt;/strong&gt;

The name of God is never mentioned in the entire book of Esther, yet you can clearly see Him at work through the book. This 4 week Small Group Curriculum and 4 week Sermon series obviously complement each other perfectly, but they also can be used as stand alone studies.

Through these 4 week studies, your students will read through the book of Esther and gain an in-depth knowledge of the book, as well as important take aways for our lives today, from standing up for what you believe in and taking risks for God, to what it means to walk Humbly with Him.

&lt;strong&gt;Car Wash Fundraiser kit&nbsp;&ndash; (Normally $10)&lt;/strong&gt;

Doing Youth Group Fundraisers is something that most Youth Pastors is accustomed to, and we&rsquo;re always looking for easier ways of doing it. One of the most commonly done fundraisers with any group of teens is a car wash, but how often do you spend hours upon hours preparing for one, spending the money on the tools to do it, and corral teens for a few hours to actually wash the cars, all to end up with only a few hundred bucks.

With a car wash-a-thon, you can guarantee an increase in your return. We used this method recently with only 13 students, and made over $7500! We can&rsquo;t guarantee you&rsquo;ll make that much, but we do know, this is one of our favorite fundraisers.

&lt;strong&gt;Event Save the date card&nbsp;&ndash; (Normally $5)&lt;/strong&gt;

You know you have that huge event on your calendar a few months from now, but do your students and parents know about it? It&rsquo;s never too early to start promoting those far away events, and this save the date card is the perfect solution to get the word out with plenty of time.

You can fully customize everything on this card, change the font, change the color, change the text! It works great for Fall Retreat promotion, but it can be any event you want!

&lt;strong&gt;Youth Ministry Invite Card&nbsp;&ndash; (Normally $5)&lt;/strong&gt;

The size of the average business card is the perfect size for quick invite cards for Youth Ministry events, services and more! This download contains the photoshop file to customize this great 3.5&Prime;x 2&Prime; business card that your students can share with friends, and though the example shown is for a High School Midweek service, you can change that to any event or service you want!

&lt;strong&gt;From Here to There 3 week Sermon Series and Questions&nbsp;&ndash; (Normally $10)&lt;/strong&gt;

The Woman at the well.&nbsp;Matthew at his tax collector booth.&nbsp;The disciples on the road to Emmaus.&nbsp;Peter on his Fishing boat after the crucifixion.

Jesus encountered these, and many more, in moments of complete desperation, at their lowest, while lost. Yet in each of these stories, He redeems them, and sends them to greater things.&nbsp;When we read these four stories, we see them where Jesus finds them, and read about where he sends them.

But how do we get from point A, to point B. How do we get from lost to found? This Sermon series is a great theme to start the new year in January.

This download also contains a 21 day bible reading plan to coincide with the sermon&rsquo;s that you can print as is, or customize for your group. It also includes a blank instagram template with the series artwork for posting the daily scripture or sermon quotes as you go.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve also included discussion questions to go along with the sermons, that are great for Small Groups.

Spanning the length of an entire semester (17 weeks), 'How To Stay Awesome' is a fun, practical, easy-to-apply exegetical study through the book of James. Each week believers will be challenged to make more of their faith, and unbelievers will be challenged to put their faith in Christ with an easy-to-understand evangelical appeal for each week.

This series covers topics such as Discipline, Perseverance, Temptation, Bullying, Evangelism, Cussing, Gossiping, Favoritism, and every thing else that can be found in the book of James! And instead of narrowing it down to a shorter series, I decided to include all 17 weeks, and allow you to pick and choose which weeks you want to teach on (or do all 17)! 17 lessons for $20...this deal can't be beat! :)

I have included the lessons for each week in .PDF, Word Doc, as well as Pages files. The verses for each week are .PNG files. I have also included the .PSD files to edit the sermon title screen as well as the Verse Template.
